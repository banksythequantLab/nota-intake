# Nota Intake — bilingual law-firm intake by phone

**The form is four fields. The phone call is the intake.**

A prospective client leaves their name and number on a web form (English or Spanish). Within a minute,
a CALL-E agent calls them back, runs a structured legal-intake interview in the language their number
supports, and returns a record an intake paralegal can act on: matter type, summary, the other party's
name for the conflict check, deadlines, urgency, best time to reach them, confirmed email, and consent.
The attorney reviews it in a small console and schedules a consultation-reminder call with one click.

Live demo: **https://nota-intake.pages.dev** (form) · `/review` (attorney console, token-protected)

Built for the CALL-E *"Your Code Is Calling"* hackathon by Nota.Lawyer / Derek Soltis.

## Why phone, not form

Long intake forms get abandoned, and the people a small firm most wants to reach — older clients,
people on a phone at work, Spanish speakers facing an English-only site — don't fill them out. A short
callback interview meets them where they are and produces *better* structured data than a form, because
the agent can ask one follow-up.

## What CALL-E does at runtime

Every intake and every reminder is a real `POST /v1/calls` from a Cloudflare Pages Function:

| Step | CALL-E feature used |
| --- | --- |
| Callback within a minute of form submit | `POST /v1/calls` with `recipients[{phones, region, locale}]` |
| Interview script in EN or ES, with legal preamble | `task` (see `functions/_intake.js`) |
| Paralegal-ready record | `recipient_result_schema` (JSON Schema, 10 fields) |
| Terminal result pushed to the app | `webhook_url` → `/api/calle-webhook` |
| Authoritative state, transcript, confidence, evidence | `GET /v1/calls/{id}` (`syncIntake`) |
| No duplicate calls on retry | `Idempotency-Key` = intake id |
| Consultation reminder call in the client's language | second `POST /v1/calls` with `REMINDER_SCHEMA` |

## Languages and regions

The interview language is chosen per phone number from CALL-E's published
[Supported Regions and Languages](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations#supported-regions-and-languages)
table (42 countries, `public/regions.json`). The form shows the caller which languages their number supports.

Verified by live calls (2026-09-04/05):

- **US (+1) numbers: English and Bahasa Indonesia** (`en-US`, `id`). Both ran real intake calls.
- **US numbers reject Spanish** — via REST `locale` (`es`, `es-US`, `es-MX`, even with `region: "MX"`),
  via Spanish task text with `locale: "en-US"` (the planner catches the intent), and via MCP
  `plan_call --language Spanish` (offers "English or Bahasa for US" instead). It's a per-line capability,
  not a validation gap. Spanish interviews currently run for Mexico (local line), Spain and Honduras.
- **Language is locked per call.** In the Bahasa test the bot offered to switch to English when asked and
  then couldn't — STT and TTS run in the call's locale. The form's language choice is binding.

The Spanish script is complete and wired; the day CALL-E enables Spanish on US lines, the only change is one
row in `regions.json`. Adding any language = one row there + one script block in `functions/_intake.js`.

  participant C as Client (browser)
  participant P as Cloudflare Pages + Functions
  participant K as KV (INTAKES)
  participant E as CALL-E
  participant A as Attorney (/review)
  C->>P: POST /api/intake {name, phone, email?, lang, locale, matter?, consent}
  P->>P: regionFor(phone) → region + allowed locales; build interview task
  P->>E: POST /v1/calls (task, recipients, recipient_result_schema, webhook_url, Idempotency-Key)
  E-->>P: {id, status}
  P->>K: put intake record (status: calling)
  E->>C: 📞 intake interview (EN/ES)
  E->>P: POST /api/calle-webhook?s=secret
  P->>E: GET /v1/calls/{id}
  P->>K: update record (result, transcript, confidence, status)
  A->>P: GET /api/intakes?token=…  (or &sync=1 to poll)
  A->>P: POST /api/remind {id, when}
  P->>E: POST /v1/calls (reminder task, REMINDER_SCHEMA)
```

Everything runs on Cloudflare (Pages, Functions, KV). No servers, no framework, no build step.

## Files

```
public/index.html          bilingual form; loads /regions.json for the country → language picker
public/review.html         attorney console: records, transcript, confidence, "schedule reminder call"
public/regions.json        CALL-E region/language matrix (generated from the integrations README)
functions/api/intake.js    POST /api/intake  — validate, pick locale, create the CALL-E call, store record
functions/api/calle-webhook.js  POST — terminal result; re-fetches authoritative state from CALL-E
functions/api/intakes.js   GET  /api/intakes — review list (token), optional sync of in-flight calls
functions/api/remind.js    POST /api/remind  — reminder call in the client's language
functions/_intake.js       interview scripts (EN/ES), RESULT_SCHEMA, reminder script + schema
functions/_calle.js        syncIntake(): GET /v1/calls/{id} → KV record
functions/_regions.js      same matrix as regions.json, for the Functions
wrangler.toml              Pages config, KV binding
```

## Run it yourself

```bash
npm i -g wrangler            # or use npx
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars   # then fill in CALLE_API_KEY, REVIEW_TOKEN, WEBHOOK_SECRET
npx wrangler pages dev public --kv=INTAKES --port 8799
# open http://127.0.0.1:8799  and  http://127.0.0.1:8799/review
```

Deploy:

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create INTAKES          # paste the id into wrangler.toml
npx wrangler pages project create nota-intake --production-branch main
echo "$CALLE_API_KEY" | npx wrangler pages secret put CALLE_API_KEY --project-name nota-intake
# same for CALLE_BASE_URL (https://api.heycall-e.com), REVIEW_TOKEN, WEBHOOK_SECRET
npx wrangler pages deploy --branch main
```

Locally the webhook can't reach you; the review page's **Sync with CALL-E** button (`?sync=1`) polls instead.

## The interview

The agent opens by confirming the caller's name, then states — in the caller's language — that this is an
intake call, not legal advice, and that no attorney-client relationship exists until an attorney confirms in
writing. It then asks, conversationally: matter in their own words (one follow-up if unclear); other parties
(conflict check); deadlines or court dates; urgency; best time to call (asks AM/PM if ambiguous); email
(spelled back, or just confirmed if given on the form); consent to phone and email contact. It never quotes
fees, never gives legal advice, never promises outcomes, and closes by saying an attorney will review.

Result schema (`recipient_result_schema`):

```json
{ "full_name": "…", "email": "…", "preferred_language": "…",
  "matter_type": "contract | litigation | international_discovery | …",
  "matter_summary": "2-3 sentences in English", "opposing_party": "for the conflict check, or 'none'",
  "urgency": "low | normal | high", "deadline_or_court_date": "verbatim or 'none'",
  "best_time_to_call": "…", "consent_to_contact": "yes | no | unknown" }
```

## What a real call looks like

From the first full test (2026-09-04, English, US number). Completion confidence **0.92 / high**:

```
bot:  Hi, is this Derek Soltis?
user: Hello? Yes. It is.
bot:  I'm calling from Nota Lawyer about your website consultation request to gather intake information;
      this is not legal advice, and no attorney-client relationship exists until an attorney confirms it in writing.
bot:  What's the legal matter in your own words?
user: I'm suing Acme Corp for not delivering what they said they were. It's a contract dispute.
bot:  Any other party names I should check for conflicts?
user: Wildy coyote.
…
```

```json
{ "matter_type": "contract", "urgency": "high", "opposing_party": "Acme Corp; Wildy coyote",
  "deadline_or_court_date": "none", "consent_to_contact": "yes", … }
```

## Limits and honest notes

- CALL-E is outbound-only, so the web form is the trigger; the firm's inbound line is out of scope here.
- Spanish for US numbers is not available on CALL-E today (see above). In production, Nota.Lawyer routes
  those callers to a human or to its own inbound Spanish line.
- Reminder calls are placed immediately by the console; scheduling for a future time is left to the caller
  of `/api/remind` (a cron or the firm's calendar), since batch/scheduled calls are outside the current beta.
- "International" line regions are marked by CALL-E as primarily for testing.
- This is intake, not advice: the script is written so the agent never crosses that line.
